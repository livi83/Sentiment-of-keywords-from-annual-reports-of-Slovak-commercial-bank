# Sentiment of keywords from annual reports of Slovak commercial bank
###### The dataset represents extracted keyword bigrams with https://github.com/livi83/SlovaKey from documents published by commercial banks for the years 2007-2022. Lemmatization was applied to the extracted keywords and subsequently the sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) of these keywords was determined. The documents are divided into the categories of Pillar 3 Disclosure, which are documents that are required to be disclosed under Pillar 3. The second category is Pillar 3 Related, which are documents that are not directly required to be disclosed, but are related to mandatory disclosure. In the case of subcategories, we designated financial reports published at the level of a year and half a year with the summary category financial reports. The remaining subcategories match the name (type) of the document. The NAN value in the cells represents that the observed keyword did not appear in the observed document in that year.
